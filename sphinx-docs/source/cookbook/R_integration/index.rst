R Integration
=============

The Ligare library :ref:`Ligare.programming` contains
:ref:`modules<Ligare.programming.R>` for executing R scripts. Ligare
also contains an R package named ``pythonipc``.

Primarily, this integration is intended for use with R methods
that draw plots. Ligare makes it simpler to execute this kind of
R software from Python by handling much of the plumbing for you.
